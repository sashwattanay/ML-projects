# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Portfolio! This repository serves as a central hub linking to my individual machine learning project repositories. Each project demonstrates various machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Projects Overview

### [1. Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/sashwattanay/ML-Kaggle-Titanic-Challenge)
- **Description:** Predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers using Logistic Regression.
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Handled missing data in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`.
  - Engineered features like `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`.
  - Achieved a Kaggle public leaderboard score of **0.75837**.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, logistic regression.

### [2. MNIST Digit Classification](https://github.com/sashwattanay/ML-MNIST-project)
- **Description:** Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Normalized pixel intensity values using Min-Max Scaling.
  - Removed low-variance features to reduce dimensionality.
  - Achieved a test accuracy of **97.31%** with high precision and recall.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation.
